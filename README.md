# 🚀 Job Recommendation System (Streamlit)

A lightweight and interactive job recommendation web app built with Streamlit. This project matches user profiles to relevant job roles using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity over a curated dataset of job metadata.

## ✨ Key Features

  * **Content-Based Recommendations:** Utilizes TF-IDF with bigrams and cosine similarity to find the best job matches.
  * **Weighted Field Importance:** Prioritizes qualifications by applying weights: **Qualifications (×3)**, **Skills (×2)**, and **Languages (×1)**.
  * **Clean & Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit to provide a simple user experience, displaying company info, required skills, LinkedIn links, and more.
  * **Salary Insights:** Includes salary bands (Min/Max, LPA) for each job, allowing users to compare opportunities at a glance.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The recommendation logic follows a simple yet effective pipeline:

1.  **Text Preprocessing:** Job metadata is cleaned by converting text to lowercase, stripping punctuation, and collapsing excess whitespace.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** A single text feature is created for each job by combining its qualifications, skills, and programming languages with the specified weights.
3.  **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The combined text features are converted into a numerical matrix using `TfidfVectorizer`, configured with `ngram_range=(1,2)` and a maximum of 500 features.
4.  **Similarity Ranking:** Cosine similarity is calculated between the user's input and all jobs in the dataset. The system then returns a ranked list of the most similar and distinct job titles.
