### **Part 2: The `requirements.txt` File**

**What it is:** This file lists all the Python packages your project depends on (like `streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`). This allows anyone to install the exact same packages using a single command.

**How to Create It:**
1.  Open your PowerShell terminal and make sure you are in your project directory:
    `PS C:\Users\Vedant\OneDrive\Desktop\movie reccommender system\pythonProject2>`
2.  **Activate your virtual environment.** This is a crucial step!
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Now, run this command to automatically generate the `requirements.txt` file with all the libraries you've installed in your `venv`:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
This will create a new file named `requirements.txt` in your project folder. It will contain lines like:
```txt
pandas==2.1.0
scikit-learn==1.3.1
streamlit==1.28.2
... and so on
